# Data Transmission Using LiFi

_Course Instructor: Dr. Aashish Mathur_

This project demonstrates the use of Li-Fi technology to transmit data wirelessly using light. Li-Fi, short for Light Fidelity, is a wireless communication technology that uses light waves instead of radio waves to transmit data. It offers several advantages over traditional Wi-Fi, such as higher speeds, lower latency, and improved security.
